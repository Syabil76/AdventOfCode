I decided to partake in this especially hair pulling and intrusive-thought-inducing coding --challenge-- to try to take my coding abilities from beginner to somewhat intermediate.

Day 1 - ok difficulty and took a couple of hours to solve // give me a break, I hadn't done python since last year and had to oil up my thinking brain
Day 2- not so difficult, solved relatively in a short amount of time with some creative solutions
Day 3- this was probably what it felt like when dean winchester went to hell, my friends even pointed out some of my hairs have turned completely white- 
in any case, it had an eloquent solution that I had to keep rewriting because I hadn't fully fleshed out how to actually execute it, simple in concept, yes, executing? thats the beginner hell.
